#summarize the project and what it was problem solving
For this project I created a clock for ChadaTech so their clients will be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than 
just the standard 12-hour clock.
#What I did particularly well
I think that I did a good job at creating a clock that did exactly what was asked by having a 12-hour and 24-hour clock.
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I did have some bugs in my code I could have tried to fix and adding in more explanitory comments. 
#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
It was challenging for me to compile all of my work into one and have it programmed to display the right way for the users to see. 
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project taught me how to program a clock which I have never done before. It was a learning process to create a clock that displayed both 12 and 24 hours.
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used the correct amount of spacing and some in-line comments so reading it would be easier. I tried to make it adaptable by creating my program small and to the point,
it can be easily adaptable.
